## R Markdown

Exercise 1.b of sta426. We take 100 samples from a log-normal distribution with mean 1 and variance 0.25.

```{r log-normal distribution}
samples <- rlnorm(100, meanlog = 0, sdlog = .25) #mean should be 1, so meanlog is 0
```

## Including Plots

Histogram produced by the samples. The samples have the following mean and variance.

mean : 1.032939
variance : 0.06516552

```{r plot}
hist(samples)
```
